## Usage

```

Where `[OPTIONS]` are optional flags you can pass to Tracer to modify its behavior. More about options [later](#options).

## GUI

---

Tracer also offers a GUI in form of a webapp. You can run the webapp by executing the following command:

```bash
python tracer --web tracer
```

This will run the webapp on port 12345. Tracer should automatically open your browser and connect to the webapp. If not, open your browser manually and type `http://127.0.0.1:12345` into the search bar and hit enter.
